# Instagram Followers Script

Tired of finding out which friends you follow have unfollowed you? Try this script to quickly find these old "friends" that have done this!

To do this, you need to login to Instagram and request a download of your account information. This can be done by clicking on the "more" hamburger menu (3 horizontal bars on top of each other) on the bottom left of the Instagram desktop. Next, click "Your Activity" and then "Download Your Information." Receiving your downloaded information may take a bit. Finally, copy and paste your followers and following data into `followers.py` and `following.py` respectively.

This script attempts to circumvent the issue of web scraping that Instagram can detect and then flag your account for.
